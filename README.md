# Elderly People Personal Assistant VR Simulator

# Personal Assistant Missions:
Elderly people daily life routines include doing some basic stuff at their home, going down across the town center to go to the supermarket. Furthermore, they may need to go to the bank from time to time. Here comes the personal assistant to help them navigate to these destinations, record their needs from those destinations and memorize it for them. Moreover, it can help with some problems
and distractions they might face going to their destinations.
# Improving Memory and Cognitive Skills:
The assistant will be a guide through the navigation missions, however, it will lead the first time only and will ask them to go
second time by themselves. Thus, it will help them improve their memory skills.Throughout their day, there will be some distractions like mobile ringing, people talking to them while they are performing a certain task. By that time, the assistant will disappear and let them cope with these distractions to see if they can remember what were they doing before these distractions. Then it will appear to remind them if they couldnâ€™t. By that and some other distractions scenarios, their cognitive skills will be improved.
